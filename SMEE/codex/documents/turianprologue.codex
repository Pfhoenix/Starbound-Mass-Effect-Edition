    "Known for their militaristic and disciplined culture, the turians gained their seat on the Council after defeating the hostile krogan during the Krogan Rebellions.", 
	"The turians deployed a salarian-created biological weapon called the genophage, which virtually sterilised the krogan and sent them into a decline. The turians then filled the peacekeeping niche left by the once-cooperative krogan, and eventually gained a Council seat in recognition of their efforts."
