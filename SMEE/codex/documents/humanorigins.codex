    "Humanity was a flourishing species with a high evolution rate and extremely hardy in terms of healing, recovery and endurance. they were the first race to engage in space travel, both for science and entertainment, but their limitations restricted them to their own solar system.",

    "Eventually they began to war amongst themselves more frequently, and with Earth's resources depleting, returned to the space race as each of the world's superpowers attempted to claim and colonise new planets. While in the midst of a particularly lengthy struggle to claim Mars, the humans observed a Beast From Beyond The Stars crash land on Earth.",

    "World leaders were heard to exclaim 'it's like something out of a sci-fi movie' and 'we'd better run for it' and 'maybe it's friendly, let's not be hasty'. (This person was later fired.)"
