    "Turian society is highly regimented and very organized, and the species is known for its strict discipline and work ethic.",
	"Turians are willing to do what needs to be done, and they always follow through. They are not easily spurred to violence, but when conflict is inevitable, they only understand a concept of total war. They do not believe in skirmishes or small-scale battles. they use massive fleets and numbers to defeat an adversary so completely that they remove any threat of having to fight the same opponent more than once.", 
	"They do not exterminate their enemy, but so completely devastate their military that the enemy has no choice but to become a colony of the Turians. "
