    "The Asari arose on Thessia, a rich world with abundant quantities of element zero that caused much of life on Thessia to exhibit biotic tendencies. Instrumental to the rise of Asari civilization was the intervention of the Protheans.", 
	"Upon discovering the Asari, the Protheans crafted the guise of Athame, a benevolent goddess who imparted gifts of wisdom to the Asari through her guides Janiri and Lucen, a deception that allowed the Protheans to rapidly accelerate asari development.", 
	"The Protheans also genetically altered the Asari to grant them biotic capabilities, and defended Thessia from an asteroid strike and the resource-hungry oravores."
